<p>You were able to escape but you ran so fast that most of the treasure you took fell out of your pockets! You were able to get past the Ogre! You found yourself back into the town streets where people are drinking and having a good time. You trade your remaining treasure for a keg of beer and that's where the story ends!</p>
